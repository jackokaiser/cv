This letter is to express my interest in the JavaScript Developer position posted on seek.

Recently graduated with a Master of Computer Science, I am an enthusiastic developer.

% Amazing Developer :
%% research lab => independance, problem solving, creativity and initiatives
%% Skimlab => startup skills, web, independant
%% MOOC => different way of learning, open minds
Undertaking, I know how to take advantage of surrounding opportunities.
This is demonstrated by all the relevant summer internships I have been involved in.
Working in different environments lying from research laboratory to startup made me become a versatile and independent programmer.

% New to web programming, but quick learner and devoted
Even though I started web programming quite recently, learning it has been a quick process thanks to my initiatives.
Indeed, seduced by the ease to write portable applications, I have spent the last 12 months gathering as many web experiences as possible.
The most important one has been my internship at Skimlab, where I had the opportunity to develop a powerful web application
relying on new technologies and industry best practices.
More details on my experiences are available on \href{http://www.jacqueskaiser.com}{www.jacqueskaiser.com}; and being itself a project, you can browse the source code on \href{https://www.github.com/jackokaiser/chezjacking}{github}.

% I care about high quality code, and people for who I work are satisfied. Look at my references
As you will see from my \href{http://www.au.linkedin.com/pub/jacques-kaiser/28/6a8/231/en}{references} and from my website, if I join your company
you will gain an autonomous, open-minded and very efficient programmer.
From my side, I am eager to improve my proficiency by working in depth with cutting edges technologies.
Moreover being involved in a professional environment is conductive to quick learning of a sound and solid knowledge,
and it is also gratifying to contribute to a real product.

I am very excited to learn more about this opportunity and share how I will be a great fit for Zendesk.
