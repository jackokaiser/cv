This letter is to express my interest in the OpenGL Developer position posted on seek.

Since I discovered Computer Graphics, I'm a 3D enthusiast.

During my internship at Skimlab, I've implemented a GPU raytracer of implicit surfaces. As OpenGL (and so WebGL) isn't meant to be used in this way,
I almost had to code an entire rendering pipeline. This improved a lot my skills of writing shaders and GLSL code.
As WebGL is based on OpenGL ES 2.0, itself being a subset of OpenGL 3+,
I confronted to some limitations such as an unique render target.

I've used OpenGL in more conventional manner during my other internships at the iCube laboratory.
On top of learning standard Computer Graphics algorithms such as space partitioning,
I've worked hand to hand with CGoGN, a complex C++ template library providing mesh abstraction.
Moreover, I've read Effective C++ by Scott Meyers in order to improve my C++ knowledge even more.

Furthermore, I'm familiar with the Unix environment and command line.
Relying on gcc and makefiles for the compilation; I often use gdb in combination to GNU Binutils for the debug.
For scripting languages, I master both bash and python.
Additionally, I also know my way around Emacs-lisp in order to customize my text editor.

I look forward to discussing this position with you in more detail. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Jacques KAISER
