This letter is to express my interest in the JavaScript Developer position posted on seek.

Recently graduated with a Master of Computer Science, I am an enthusiastic developer.

% Amazing Developer :
%% research lab => independance, problem solving, creativity and initiatives
%% Skimlab => startup skills, web, independant
%% MOOC => different way of learning, open minds
Far more that just being an assiduous student, I have always seized opportunities to my advantage.
Example of this includes all the relevant internships I have made during every summer holidays.
Working in environment lying from research lab to start up made me a versatile and independent programmer.

% New to web programming, but quick learner and devoted
Even though I started web programming quite recently, my initiatives made me learn it quickly.
Seduced by the ease to write portable applications, I have spent the last 12 months gathering as many web experiences as possible.
The most relevant one has been my internship at Skimlab, where I had the opportunity to raise a powerful web application
relying on new technologies and industry best practices. More details on my experiences are available on www.jacqueskaiser.com;
and being itself a project, you can browse the source code on github.

% I care about high quality code, and people for who I work are satisfied. Look at my references
As you will see from my references and from my website, if I have the opportunity to join your company
you will gain an autonomous, open-minded and very efficient programmer.
From my side, I am eager to improve my proficiency by working in depth with cutting edges technologies.

I am very excited to learn more about this opportunity and share how I will be a great fit for Zendesk.
